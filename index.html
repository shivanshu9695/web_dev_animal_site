        <p>
          The rare breed is a great choice for first-time owners because of its 
          calm, sweet nature. Young children, however, are not recommended to care 
          for them since they are shy and may bite if not handled gently. With a 
          great grooming routine and healthy diet, the American rabbit can live up 
          to 12 years.

        <h3>Meet Belgian Hare Rabbit</h3>
        <p>
          Tracing its roots back to the 18th century, the Belgian Hare is one of 
          the oldest breeds. It thrives best outdoors with ample space and hay. 
          It's considered high maintenance, mostly due to its nervous personality â€” 
          known to easily spook if people don't properly announce themselves before 
          approaching it.

          Originating from France, the Blanc de Hotot can easily be spotted by its

          these bunnies do well with children and other pets as long as they grow 
          up with them. Dedicated brushing time and taking walks outside are amazing 
          ways to bond with them.

          Developed in England in the 1830s, the Dutch is one of the most popular

          depressed if it spends too much time in its cage. Thanks to its easygoing 
          attitude, children are more than welcomed to care for it.

          not uncommon to see a Flemish Giant playing with dogs and even cuddling 
          with them if they live together. Children of any age are encouraged to 
          pet them, but not attempt to carry them due to their size.

        <h3>Meet Budgerigar</h3>
        <p>
          Enjoying popularity around the world, budgies (also known as parakeets) are
          some of the best pet birds for good reason. When properly tamed and cared 
          for, these birds can be extraordinarily friendly and affectionate. They 
          are also singing birds that love to chirp, and can be kept solo or in pairs. 
          On top of being small and fairly low-maintenance, budgies take well to training 
          and can learn to perform many fun bird tricks, including learning to talk. 
          Budgies are good for beginners to bird ownership.

        <h3>Meet Cockatiel</h3>
        <p>
          The captivating cockatiel is another great choice for anyone who wants a 
          friendly and affectionate pet bird. Hailing from Australia, these birds 
          make excellent pets when hand-fed as babies and raised in positive environments.
           They're very emotional, and the crest on the top of their head reflects how 
           they feel. While they don't normally learn to talk, cockatiels are exceptionally 
           intelligent. Many learn to whistle quite well and mimic common household noises, 
           such as doorbells, telephones, and microwaves. Cockatiels are good for beginners, 
           and it's best to keep them in pairs because they don't like being alone.

        <h3>Meet Hyacinth Macaw</h3>
        <p>
          Known as "gentle giants," hyacinth macaws are the largest of all parrots. 
          And as sociable and friendly birds, they love nothing more than to spend 
          time playing and cuddling with their owners. Due to their size, it can be 
          difficult for most people to provide proper housing for these birds. 
          But those who are able to meet their needs are rewarded with an incredible 
          relationship with their feathered friend. Hyacinth macaws are best for 
          experienced bird owners.

        <p>
          Spunky and relatively easy to care for, parrotlets are known for having 
          personalities much larger than their tiny bodies. Those considering 
          parrotlets must have plenty of time to play and socialize with their pets, 
          as these birds can become a little wild without regular handling. People 
          who interact with their parrotlets every day are usually able to form 
          strong bonds with these comical little birds.

          Also native to South America, Hahn's macaws are the smallest macaws. But 
          they pack a lot of personality into their compact bodies. They are intelligent
           and playful birds that tend to be gentle when properly socialized and handled. 
           These macaws prefer to spend as much time interacting with their caretakers 
           as possible and might become depressed if they feel ignored. They also can 
           be rather noisy, though some do learn to talk quite well. Hahn's macaws are 
           best for experienced bird owners.

        <h3>Meet Eclectus Parrot</h3>
        <p>
          Native to rainforests in the Solomon Islands, the eclectus parrot is a species 
          with striking dimorphism, meaning the males and females look very different; 
          the males are bright green while the females are red. These large parrots are 
          very friendly and intelligent, but do best in a home without too much hustle 
          and bustle, as they are easily stressed by noise and tumult. They thrive with 
          lots of socialization and predictable daily routines. Eclectus parrots easily 
          learn to talk, but generally aren't as noisy as some other parrot species.

          Weight: 13 to 18 ounces

        <h3>Meet Appaloosa</h3>
        <p>
          The colorful spotted Appaloosa was originally developed for hunting and battle 
          by the Nez Perce Native Americans. The breed is believed to be a descendant of 
          wild horses mixed with the thoroughbred, American quarter horse, and Arabian. 
          This hardy, versatile horse is great for herding, pleasure riding, long-distance 
          trail riding, and more. Their diet can consist of hay, grass, grains, fruits, 
          and vegetables, as well as vitamin and mineral supplements. White horses might 
          need more frequent grooming, including baths with horse shampoo, and these 
          horses might need sunscreen to protect against sun damage.

          Breed Overview
          Group: Light         
          Height: 14 hands (56 inches) to 16 hands (64 inches)

        <h3>Meet Warmbloods</h3>
        <p>
          In equine circles, the terms "hot-blooded," "warm-blooded," and "cold-blooded" 
          are used to categorize a horse's temperament, size, and origin. Medium-size 
          horses, including the American quarter horse, Hanoverian, Cleveland bay, and 
          Canadian, are considered warmbloods with a European heritage. They contain a 
          touch of the spirit you get from lithe, "hot-blooded" thoroughbreds or Arabians 
          combined with the calm demeanor of "cold-blooded" working horses. And that 
          balanced temperament makes for a popular horse.

        <h3>Meet Morgan</h3>
        <p>
          The strength and elegance of the Morgan have made it a popular horse breed. 
          As the official horse breed of Vermont, the muscle of the Morgan was used 
          for clearing and tilling New England farms during colonial times. Today, 
          this is a popular driving and riding horse. They're surefooted over rough 
          trail and dignified in the show ring. Because they're easy keepers, they don't 
          need as much food as other breeds, and a standard grooming routine is all you 
          need to keep their skin and coat clean and healthy.

          Breed Overview
          Group: Light
          Height: 14 hands (56 inches) to 15 hands (60 inches)
          Weight: 900 to 1,100 pounds

        <h3>Meet Thoroughbred</h3>
        <p>
          Thoroughbreds are the most popular racing horse in North America. This 
          breed is considered "hot-blooded," which means it's known for agility, 
          speed, and spirit. This is a fine multipurpose horse that often has a career 
          in other equestrian competitions besides racing, such as dressage and jumping. 
          Or they simply live as a companion animal kept for pleasure riding. Because 
          of their fast metabolism, you might need to feed a thoroughbred more food 
          than other breeds, but a standard equine diet should be sufficient. Also, 
          gentle grooming is best for these horses because their skin tends to be more 
          sensitive.

          Breed Overview
          Group: Light
          Height: 15 hands (60 inches) to 17 hands (68 inches)
          Weight: 1,000 to 1,300 pounds
          Physical Characteristics: Deep chest; lean body; long, flat muscles; delicate head

        <h3>Meet Arabian</h3>
        <p>
          The Arabian has the oldest horse breed registry in the world. Its lineage 
          goes as far back as 3000 B.C. In fact, every light horse breed, including
           Appaloosas, Morgans, and Andalusians, can trace their ancestry back to 
           the Arabian. This can be a rather spirited horse, so not all beginners 
           can handle them. But they're also generally a loving and loyal horse. 
           In terms of care, they may need less food compared to other breeds, and 
           a standard grooming routine will be sufficient to keep them looking 
           beautiful.

           Breed Overview

        <h3>Meet American Quarter Horse</h3>
        <p>
          Embraced by beginners and professional equestrians all around the world, 
          the American quarter horse is famous for agility, docility, and athleticism. 
          Originally bred during the 1600s from English and Spanish thoroughbreds 
          crossed with local breeds such as the Native American Chickasaw horse, it 
          has the largest breed registry in the world. These horses are shining stars 
          on the trail and in the show ring. Keeping them isn't difficult, as they 
          need a basic grooming routine and can be fed a diet that consists of various 
          hays and grains, as well as treats that include fruits and vegetables.

        <h3>Meet Chimpanzees</h3>
        <p>
          The Chimpanzee is the largest type of primate you might find as a 
          pet and it is not actually a monkey. They are considered apes. You

        <p>
          Macaques are smaller primates that can live up to 30 years. This 
          type of pet monkey needs a large, secure cage, so they don't get 
          lost in your house or run outside and climb poles and other fixtures.
          While Macaques are smaller, they still require extremely large 
          enclosures, at least 30 feet square.

        <p>
          Tamarins weigh less than a pound but will live about 15 years in 
          captivity.
          These primates require very secure cages with tiny bar spacing, 
          as they can escape or get stuck in the bars.

          especially if mistreated.
